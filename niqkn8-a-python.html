                            <p> https://s.orbis.zone/1hif I have 137 million astro-dollars at the moment, so I can definitely afford this build, especially since I'mma head back to LYR space to buy it at that sweet 15% off. What's the general opinion on what I've chosen to D-rate and what I've A-rated, among other things? I ended up A-rating the FSD simply because the jump range is crap without it, and every extra leg of a journey increases the odds of getting pirated. I'm not seeing anything that I am missing offhand.

(based on another library written by JECSands. Been using google sheets as my main budgeting tool due to a service called Tiller. So far I love it because it’s just my raw transactions and I can create my own budget and slice and dice the data to my hearts content. However, I was more dynamic changes to take place where formulas just won’t do anymore. I want to build a web app the uses this google sheets as a database and display my budget summary and for me to be able to interact or refresh data through I saw someone had posted a link to the website last night and I felt compelled to make their submissions filled with garbage they have to sift through.

You will need to have selenium and the firefox driver installed as well, link on how to do that: here (https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io. Hey Fellas! I was looking for something interesting while programming and I found a Python Library which allows you to make Windows 10 Notifications. So, I made a CS:GO Stats Notification Python Script. How it looks Like: https://i.imgur.com/xnh8AWL.png Python Script: https://pastebin.com/raw/rgqNin8z How to run: - First of all, make sure you have Python Installed. (https://www.python.org/downloads/) - open cmd as Admin and install two dependencies using pip: pip install win10. 
Trying to build a solid sample size of stuff to learn EDIT: What I’ve been seeing a good amount of is besides writing clean, pythonic code, learning and understanding how to use data structures is what made a good handful of people better programmers. Interesting. 5 weeks ago I bought my kid (7) a book named 'Programming Python games for kids'. I bought it because programming tickled my interest when I was that age (@echo off, Basic anyone?) and we both like gaming. However, instead of him reading the book and learning Python, I digged into it and Python got me in it's grip. Besides the book, I (ofcourse) checked a lot of tutorials and searched for documentation, because I was hungry for more! I am still, and the problem now is that I cannot stop (gett. def shift(board, d = 1): r = np.arange(len(board)) return(np.concatenate( np.concatenate( r i 0 , board i , r -i-1 0 ::d ) for i in r )) I'm trying to check if someone has won a game of Connect Four. To check the diagonals, I tilt the board by moving the nth row over by either n or -n. This function accomplishes that in basically one line of code, adding 0s for the filler spaces, and changing the direction it tilts in by setting Cross-validation, a popular tool in machine learning and statistics, is crucial for model selection and hyperparameter tuning. To use this tool, one often requires that the data are independent and identically distributed  However, this hypothesis is violated by time series, where successive data points are interdependent. Many cross-validation packages, such as scikit-learn, rely on the independence hypothesis and thus cannot help for time series. To solve this problem, I developed a python. The Python programmer comes back to you in an hour with a program that takes a month to run. The C programmer comes back to you in a month with a program that takes a minute to run. The Java programmer comes back to you in two months with a very clear specification of the problem. Here is the tutorial https://github.com/AhmadMoussa/Python-Midi-Ableton/blob/master/Readme.md (https://github.com/AhmadMoussa/Python-Midi-Ableton/blob/master/Readme.md) . It took me like an hour to create this, but I think this could be of help to some of you, since I absolutely couldn't figure it out through resources online and had to piece it together by myself. Ableton doesn't really have documentation on that, nor is there much information on how to do this on windows, since The Formula 1 app, with a F1 tv subscription, gives a screen like this (https://i.imgur.com/SfOMMTn.png). I made a python script the go through a recording frame by frame and extract all the data provided to create something like this (https://i.imgur.com/uKG1jyD.png). I made a video briefly going over the program and the code itself can also be found in the video description here (https://youtu.be/VUgvhnQawbw). 
Buggify is a Python bugger which automatically inserts a random variety of syntax and logical errors into a program file. I spend of lot of time lurking here and in /r/learnpython and I keep reading how the majority of programming is reading code and fixing bugs. I searched for tutorials to practice reading and debugging code and came up short. Buggify is my answer to that. Buggify generates a copy of your code into a file and puts a bunch of bugs into that copy. It also generates an answer. Hello everyone, Today I would like to share with you a project that I started almost 2 years ago. It will be a long post, so here is a TDLR. TDLR : pyts ( GitHub (https://github.com/johannfaouzi/pyts), PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/pyts/), ReadTheDocs (https://pyts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)): a Python package for time series transformation and classification. It aims to make time series classification easily accessible by providing preprocessing and utility tools, and implemen. 2019 Kaggle Inc. Our Team Terms Privacy Contact/Support. Moved Permanently.

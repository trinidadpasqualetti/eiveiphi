                            <p> The guardians were in London last night and although I was hesitant to go, a friend of mine convinced me that I should move my ass to London. And l have to admit it was a great idea, because they kicked ass without taking prisoners. Set started with "Ninth wave", followed by "Welcome to dying", "Nightfall" and "Prophecies" which already had the crowed going crazy. And after the final note from Prophecies, Hansi addressed the audience, to remind them that back in the Spring they promised. LAST TIME: And The Story Ends was voted out.

So, ever since I've gotten into Power Metal, I've become obsessed with Concept albums. Thus, I'm a huge fan of Ayreon, Kamelot, Blind Gaurdian, Metalium, and Rhapsody of Fire. Anyhow, I've been wanting to a) find some new story-based concept albums to enjoy, and b) been thinking it would be cool to create a huge list for the community. So, just the thought here would be to put down whatever Power Metal concept albums you know, and later on I'll just compile the list and put it somewhere. </p>

                            <p> SPOILER Has anyone noticed how the outline of the person on the cover of this book is in a similar position to Brian's body when found in the cave. Also, a similar portion of Brian's body is covered in rock as the person on the cover is covered in red. Do you think the title literally refers to Brian as "Six Feet Down Under?" Photos of the two here: http://imgur.com/a/l2q9d. The book that Jon finds is called "Six Feet Down Under" which makes me believe that the main characters wife (who is in Australia) may have died while he is doing fire watch. This is entirely speculation, so I'm sorry if this ends up being a spoiler. 1. A New Day's Coming 2. Young and Doomed 3. Fever Dream 4. The Host 5. Basement Eyes 6. Ode to Destruction 7. The Unfortunate 8. Moto Pop 9. Medicine Square Garden 10. No Love 11. Police Police 12. Great Party 13. Six Feet Down Under 
Hiding lies disguised by bitter tears Denys me brighter years way down forgotten fears overwelm me, darkened days and im living in devious ways and im thinking about the next play to be made would i trade it.quick. You can have it with the habit this drug addict has had it with this pain every hand just plays the same.im gonna lose either way it goes it shows the stronger it grows it slows me down, drags me across rocky ground.will it knock I saw a post on Knowyourmeme.com, which was a page about what domination lines Soldier would have if he was in Overwatch. I wondered then what Scout would say if he was in Overwatch. Here's the lines that I came up with for Scout. See what you all think of them. NOTE: I came up with all these lines myself, though, admittingly, some are easter eggs/references. I'll leave it up to you to decide which ones are. "Hey, Dopey! Where are the other dwarves?" "Woo! Is it gettin' warm in here? So I'm clearing out a bit of my backlog of shorter games before Red Dead Redemption 2 comes out next week. I finished Firewatch yesterday and today I started Tacoma. The game is great so far! amp#x200B; \ Slight Firewatch spoiler below, not story related, just exploration\ I just noticed something and wanted to confirm it. In the game Firewatch, there are some books you find lying around by an author Richard Sturgeon, the titles of the books all contain numbers ScoutgtSoldier: "Drop dead and gimme twenty!" ScoutgtPyro: "Repeat after me: mhmm-mhmm-mhmm I'm dead!'" ScoutgtHeavy: "0,000 to fire that gun, huh? Yeah, money well spent!" ScoutgtSniper: "If you order now, I'll throw in a second beatin', absolutely free." (Because Scout looks like the Sham-wow guy) SoldiergtScout: "You kids today don't know how to dominate." SoldiergtPyro: "You cannot burn me, I'm already on fire!" SoldiergtDemo: "Scotland is not a real country;. So, fun story. My irrigation pump lost prime so I went to go reprime it since I have a small leak somewhere, this happens. However this time the water just kept going and wouldn't fill up. So I look down in the well and about four feet down the rest of my pipe is gone. I can see it about six feet down under about two feet of water. That stupid foot valve on the end of the 2 inch PVC was about fifty bucks. Does anyone know of a trick to pull up the pipe so I can save money and don't have fifteen. A bunch of the songs on Cultureleak won't play for some reason i.e. Six Feet Under. Does anyone have downloads for the leaks. 
One Chance to Die Death Strikes at Two Three Blind Rats The Fourth Estate Five Degrees North Six Feet Down Under Terminal Seven Eight Rolled the Hard Way Nine lives lost Ten to One My girlfriend and I wrote these down and were sure there was going to be some sort of combination lock that referenced the book titles like Death - Rats - Terminal - Estate would 2-3-7-4 for example - we got fixated on it and nothing happened!!. I think we need some post for this game that contains all ~~riddles??~~, secrets, easter eggs and interesting theories (like all in 1). Here it is what can I show you: Hidden audio tape (easter egg) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTWx53VFFPk I think Delilah knows about Ned existence and this moment when we can overheard her conversation with someone. So this can be Ned or this is can be conversation about "lake girls" (Thomjones idea) ~~Maybe Delilah is not a simple One Chance to Die Death Strikes at Two Three Blind Rats The Fourth Estate Five Degrees North Six Feet Down Under Terminal Seven Eight Rolled the Hard Way Nine lives lost My girlfriend and I wrote these down and were sure there was going to be some sort of combination lock that referenced the book titles like Death - Rats - Terminal - Estate would 2-3-7-4 for example - we got fixated on it and nothing happened!! Anyone. Australia (/u/aarondroidbryce) vs. Yakutia (/u/TriggerDarkhan) ampnbsp; Australia : First the elephants, and now some sleeping yaks, Who told you I hate animals? Your givin' me the cacks. Maybe Trigger can rap, but Tygyn is still taking his nap Your civ has done nothing, fairly sure it’s comatose, And this battle will end with your followers lachrymose. I didn't even see your tiles in this last part. Surely by now even you must be losing heart. Bordered by two hordes 
Seriously bugging out that I feel so down right now. I just spend 20 minuets walking around in a circle thinking about my life and what I am going to be remembered for, or if there is something that I regret. mmfb?. </p>
